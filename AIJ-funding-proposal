A proposal should contain the following sections:
New or recurrent?
Label your activity as either new
or recurrent. If it is new, explain why it is needed and
what its potential impact on AI and society is.



What?
Describe exactly what activity funding is re-
quested for.   Please note that AIJ funds
specific
activities.  For example, “we request funds to support a
conference on
X
” is
not
a specific request, while “we
request travel funds to bring
X
students to conference
Y
”
is
a specific request.
How Much?
A (high level) budget,
in Euros
, which:
clearly states the amount requested; provides details
of the use of requested funds; describes how the re-
quested amount fits into an overall budget for the ac-
tivity/event;  and  clearly  states  what  will  happen  to
funds in the event of a surplus.
Why?
Brief justification for funding; note that prior-
ity will be given to activities for which no alternative
funds are available.  If AIJ funding was received for
the same activity, please provide a short explanation
on how funds were used.
Who?
Describe who will benefit from the proposed
activity.
When?
Dates  of  the  proposed  activity,  and  date  by
which funding would be needed.  Applicants should
apply at least 3 months before the event’s dates.
Where?
Location of the proposed activity.
