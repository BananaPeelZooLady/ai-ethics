# Launching an institutional AI Ethics Committee

Following is a proposal in response to the AIJ call for funding opportunities
for promoting AI research. We propose a workshop to discuss how organizations
can form advisory committees to help researchers review projects for
potential ethical concerns and possible unintended negative impact. A small
team of researchers at PARC recently went through the exercise of forming a
committee, defining its mission, and developing the tools to be used in the
ethical review of projects. The workshop agenda will include the PARC AI ethics
committee describing the motivations and the process they followed to organize
the PARC committee. We will include other organizations who have recently gone
through similar steps as well as invited academics who focus on ethics and
technology.

## _New or recurrent?_
This proposal describes a new activity. Much of the current discussion about
ethics within the AI research community centers on developing models for agents
with moral decision making. Very little attention is paid to the impact of the
AI being developed and deployed today.

## _What?_
The requested funds will be used to provide a meal and refreshments to
attendees and to pay the travel expenses of invited speakers. The workshop
will be hosted at PARC, and since we believe strongly in the societal benefits
of such committees there will be no cost to attendees. The primary goal of the
workshop is to demonstrate how a committee can review projects for possible
ways that AI technology can cause harm to specific individuals and groups.

## _How Much?_
| Description | Amount|
|-------------|-------:|
Food and refreshments for 20 participants| €600
Travel and hotel for 2 invited speakers| €3000
Total| €3600|

PARC will cover other incidental costs like materials


## _Why?_
Institutional Review Boards were mandated for government-funded projects
involving human subjects studies due to past instances of harm that resulted
from such studies. With the increasing deployment of AI technology, we are
beginning to see similar harms to specific individuals and groups affected by
AI predictions, decision-making tools, and autonomous equipment (automobiles,
for example). We believe that an institutional ethics review committee, using a
model similar to that of an IRB, can help to mitigate those adverse effects.

The workshop is designed to help organizations deal with these immediate issues
and presents material and an opportunity for discussion that we don't believe
is happening in any other venues.

## _Who?_
Members and employees of organizations that want to adopt a responsible and
clearly defined position with regard to the social impact of their work.
Organizations who have already taken steps to mitigate concerns can
benefit and contribute to the discussion and sharing of information.

## _When?_
Spring of 2019
