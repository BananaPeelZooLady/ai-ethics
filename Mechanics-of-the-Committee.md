# Mechanics of the committee

![]({{ site.url }}/ai-ethics/assets/images/all_stakeholders_comp.jpg)


The committee will serve both as an ethics review body and as an Internal
Review Board for human subjects research.

## Assistance and Guidance to PARC Research Community

### Project Reviews

1. When a new project starts PI goes through the checklist. If the
[checklist](AI-Ethics-Checklist.md) suggests that an ethics review is
necessary, the PI should send a message to the committee email address.

2. The committee sets a date for a review session. The PI fills in a slide
template describing project and potential ethical risks and sends it to the
committee.

3. Committee members review information in template with respect to the
[Guidelines](Committee-Guidelines.md) to prepare for the review session.

4. The PI and committee meet for the review session. Together they identify risks
and plans to mitigate the risks. They may also determine whether on-going or
periodic check-ins would be useful. (Should there be "seams" to make sure the
on-going reviews happen?)

5. After the project starts, the PI notifies the committee if anything changes
that might necessitate another review.

### General Consulting

Researchers may send questions related to ethical matters for the committee to
advise on or discuss.
